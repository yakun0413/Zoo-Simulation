# Zoo-Simulation
This project is a simulation of a zoo environment where different types of animals coexist. The simulation includes a variety of animals such as Elephants, Lions, Monkeys, and Dolphins, each exhibiting unique characteristics and behaviors. These behaviors include feeding, moving, aging, making sounds, and interactions such as one animal preying upon another.

Description
The zoo simulation program consists of several classes and functions designed to mimic the behavior of animals in a controlled environment. The core classes include:

Animal Classes: Represent the base class for all animals in the zoo, defining common attributes and behaviors shared among all animal types. Subclasses such as Carnivore and Herbivore provide specialized behavior based on diet.

Zoo Class: Manages the collection of animals within the zoo, allowing for the addition of new animals, feeding, aging, and cleanup operations.

Test Function: Demonstrates the functionality of the zoo simulation by performing a series of actions such as adding animals, feeding them, simulating interactions, and aging the animals.

Main Function: Serves as the entry point of the program, calling the test function to initiate the zoo simulation.

The simulation allows users to observe how different species interact within the zoo environment over time. Users can witness behaviors such as hunting, feeding, aging, and eventual death due to old age. Additionally, the program provides insights into the management of a zoo, including the importance of monitoring animal populations and ensuring the welfare of each species.
